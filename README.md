# 🧪 React Front-End Challenge – Skip Size Page Redesign

## Overview

This repository contains my submission for a front-end coding challenge focused on redesigning a specific page in a React application. The task involved improving the UI/UX of the **“Choose Your Skip Size”** page from the [WeWantWaste](https://wewantwaste.co.uk) website.

While the original assignment required only a redesign of a single page, I went beyond that by replicating approximately **80% of the original site** and improving the UI across **multiple pages up to the payment section**.

## 💡 The Task

**Goal:**  
Redesign the "Choose Your Skip Size" page (accessible via postcode `LE10 1SH`, select an address → select garden waste) to look **completely different** while maintaining **all existing functionality**.

**Requirements:**

- Use **React** for all front-end work.
- Focus on writing **clean, maintainable code**.
- Ensure the page is fully **responsive** on both desktop and mobile.
- Improve the overall **UI/UX** of the redesign.
- Maintain parity with the original **features and user flows**.

## ✅ What I Did

- Rebuilt ~80% of the existing website layout and flow in React.
- Fully redesigned the "Choose Your Skip Size" page with a modern UI/UX.
- Extended improvements across the **address selection**, **waste selection**, and **payment flow**.
- Optimized the layout for **mobile and desktop devices**.
- Ensured all interactions are functional and aligned with the original experience.

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **React** (with functional components and hooks)
- **React Router** for page navigation
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling (or update if using SCSS or another method)
- **Responsive design principles**

## 🙌 Notes
-This is a front-end only demo; no backend services were included or modified.

-The mock data and flows are intended to simulate the original user journey as closely as possible.

-The goal was not just to redesign a page, but to demonstrate my ability to handle scalable UI improvements across a user flow.
