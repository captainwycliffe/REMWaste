# 🧪 React Front-End Challenge – Skip Size Page Redesign

## Overview

This repository contains my submission for a front-end coding challenge focused on redesigning a specific page in a React application. The task involved improving the UI/UX of the **“Choose Your Skip Size”** page from the [WeWantWaste](https://wewantwaste.co.uk) website.

While the original assignment required only a redesign of a single page, I went beyond that by replicating approximately **80% of the original site** and improving the UI across **multiple pages up to the payment section**.

## 💡 The Task

**Goal:**  
Redesign the "Choose Your Skip Size" page (accessible via postcode `LE10 1SH`, select an address → select garden waste) to look **completely different** while maintaining **all existing functionality**.

**Requirements:**

- Use **React** for all front-end work.
- Focus on writing **clean, maintainable code**.
- Ensure the page is fully **responsive** on both desktop and mobile.
- Improve the overall **UI/UX** of the redesign.
- Maintain parity with the original **features and user flows**.

## ✅ What I Did

- Fully redesigned the "Choose Your Skip Size" page with a modern UI/UX.
- Extended improvements across the **address selection**, **waste selection**, and **payment flow**.
- Optimized the layout for **mobile and desktop devices**.
- Ensured all interactions are functional and aligned with the original experience.
